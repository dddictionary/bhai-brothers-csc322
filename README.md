# Five Bhai's
## What Is Bhai Brothers?
At Bhai Brothers, our menu is a mosaic of the Indian subcontinent's diverse culinary regions, from the robust flavors of Punjab to the subtle, fish-based cuisine of Bangladesh, and beyond. Each dish is a homage to the area it represents, offering our guests a taste of local traditions and regional cooking styles that have been perfected over centuries.

The richness of Punjab is captured in our hearty, spiced curries and grilled meats, all cooked to perfection in a traditional tandoor. From Amritsari kulchas stuffed with aloo to succulent butter chicken, these dishes are aromatic and deeply satisfying.

In contrast, our offerings from Bangladesh focus on the delicate flavors of seafood, imbued with mustard seeds and turmeric, served alongside fragrant rice dishes like khichuri. These recipes reflect the waterways and lush landscapes of the region.

Beyond these, Bhai Brothers explores the coastal cuisine of Kerala with its coconut-laden curries and the sophisticated, rice-based thalis of Tamil Nadu, as well as the street food delights of Mumbai and the rich, vegetarian fare of Gujarat.

Each meal at Bhai Brothers is a passage across the Indian subcontinent, inviting our guests to explore an array of flavors as diverse and dynamic as the regions themselves. Join us for a culinary expedition that promises not only to satiate but also to enlighten, offering insights into the culinary history and cultural richness of India.
